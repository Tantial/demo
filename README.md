# demo
A collection of simple programs to demonstrate my basic coding ability. Nothing too fancy.

database.py:
  Uses pymysql to create a database connection that can be used to create simple queries and provide a high-level view of a database connection. Different connection configurations can be added in db_config.yaml

pokemon_image_scrape.py:
  I made this to demonstrate a simple use of a Beautiful Soup on a static page to pull images.

priority_items.py:
  Was an ETL for a project I was working on. There is private information cut out of it, so I'm not sure how legible it is.

TODO:
  Make a project using Scrapy to collect data from a dynamic website, using css and xpath selectors.
  Something with Spark, using Scala
  Something with design patterns
  Should probably get an ML/AI project up here, shouldn't I?
